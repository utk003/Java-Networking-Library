# Java Networking Library
This library is current in development.

Currently, the system based on Java's old IO API is complete. The NIO module is currently in development.

Library documentation is available on my website ([here](https://utk003.github.io/documentation/libs/jnl/overview-summary.html)).

*TODO: finish lib and update readme*
